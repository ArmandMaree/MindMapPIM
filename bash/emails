Hi Acuben,

Can we eat pizza after we rode horse tomorrow?

The pizza we had yesterday was really nice. Maybe we should get coffee next time.

Here is a new pizza to try out at home!

After horse riding we should get some pizza and watch a movie.

The COS301 demo is today at 11:40.

Let's have a drink at Oom Gert after the demo for COS301 to debrief.

I went to Italy recently and I have attached a photo of us drinking slushpuppies on the beach.

You should definitly come with next time. We had a lot of fun! You will enjoy it because there is a very nice horse riding club here and they have free pizza.

Did you see the new advertisement by Nandos? They showed a horse, riding a motorcycle while eating a pizza. They are always so controversial.
